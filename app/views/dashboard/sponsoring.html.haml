        Codebar has now been running for over 6 months and it has gone from strength to strength. There are over 300 students signed up and more than 70 developers offering their time for free on a regular basis. We started by running workshops in London and have recently expanded to Brighton with the help of #{link_to "Rosa Fox", "http://twitter.com/rosaemerald"} and #{link_to "Tom Ashworth", "http://twitter.com/phuunet"}. Soon we will be running workshops in Edinburgh and Glasgow.

        We need money to keep Codebar free and be able to reach out to more places. If you would like to partner up with us and offer long-term support or just to make a substantial donation, #{mail_to "despo@codebar.io", "send me an email"}.

        Other ways to help include: providing space, or getting food for one of our events. Have a look at our #{link_to "events calendar", "http://calendar.codebar.io"} and send me an email to book a date.
