                  Invites for our next workshop are now open and we are looking for coaches. The workshop will take place on #{humanize_date(@workshop.date_and_time, with_time: true)}.

                %p At the workshop you will be helping students as they work their way through one of our tutorials or a personal project they need help. Don't worry we'll only match you with someone who you'll be able to help.

                %p You can find all of our tutorials at #{link_to 'http://tutorials.codebar.io/', 'http://tutorials.codebar.io/'}. If you would like to improve any of the existing content, you can issue a pull request to our #{link_to 'GitHub repository', 'https://github.com/codebar/tutorials'}

                %p Before attending, make sure you have read and understood our #{link_to 'Code of Conduct', 'http://codebar.io/code-of-conduct'}. We have a zero tolerance policy towards conduct and expect everyone to behave appropriately. You should also go through our #{link_to 'How to be an effective teacher', 'http://codebar.io/effective-teacher-guide'}.

                %p Please note: We do not accept any RSVPs over email.

                %p.callout #{link_to 'Join us on Slack', 'https://slack.codebar.io'} to offer help and guidance outside the workshops.
