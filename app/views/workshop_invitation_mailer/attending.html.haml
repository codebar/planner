Projects that involve specific frameworks, libraries, or languages that are not part of the codebar tutorials (anything other than Ruby or Javascript) are welcome, but we cannot guarantee that a coach will be available to help you. We recommend having a backup option to work on, such as the codebar tutorials or katas (<a href='https://www.codewars.com/'>codewars.com</a> or <a href='https://exercism.org/'>exercism.org</a>).

                    If you can no longer make it, please cancel your invitation <strong>before 15:00</strong> on the day of the workshop.

                    Please remember that removing the calendar entry will not cancel your invitation RSVP.
