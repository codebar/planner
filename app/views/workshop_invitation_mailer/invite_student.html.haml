                  In our workshops, you can work through any of our #{link_to 'tutorials', 'http://codebar.github.io/tutorials' } or get help and guidance on another technology for your personal project. We believe that everyone should be entitled to free learning and our community has #{ link_to 'a lot of devoted developers', full_url_for(coaches_url)} who help out by coaching.
                %p You will also get the opportunity to meet other people interested in coding and collaborate with them.
                %p Please note: We do not accept any RSVPs over email.

                %p.callout If you are working through the tutorials outside our workshop, or need any other help or advice #{ link_to 'join the codebar Slack', 'https://slack.codebar.io'}.
