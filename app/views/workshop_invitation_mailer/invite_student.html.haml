                  If you would like to attend the workshop please RSVP as we need to know who is coming to make sure we have enough coaches and food.

                  In our workshops, you can work through any of our #{link_to 'tutorials', 'http://codebar.github.io/tutorials' } or get help and guidance on another technology for your personal project. We believe that everyone should be entitled to free learning and our community has #{ link_to 'a lot of devoted developers', full_url_for(coaches_url)} who help out by coaching.
                %p You will also get the opportunity to meet other people interested in coding and collaborate with them.
                %p Please note: We do not accept any RSVPs over email.

                %p.callout If you are working through the tutorials outside our workshop, or need any other help or advice #{ link_to 'join the codebar Slack', 'https://slack.codebar.io'}.
