                  We are looking for coaches for the workshop that will take place on #{humanize_date_with_time(@session.date_and_time, @session.time)}

                %p At the workshop you will be guiding students while they work through our tutorials. Or in other programming related areas that they request help in.

                - unless @session.invite_note.blank?
                  %p
                    = @session.invite_note.html_safe

                %p You can find all our tutorials at #{link_to "http://codebar.github.io/tutorials", "http://codebar.github.io/tutorials/"}. If you would like to improve any of the existing content, you can issue a pull request to our #{link_to "GitHub repository", "https://github.com/codebar/tutorials"}

                %p Before attending, make sure you read and understand our #{link_to "code of conduct", "http://codebar.io/code-of-conduct"}. We have a zero tolerance policy and expect everyone to behave appropriately. You should also go through our #{link_to "How to be an effective teacher", "http://codebar.io/effective-teacher-guide"}. If you have anything to add to it, please open a pull request or an issue.

                %p.callout It would be awesome if you could also #{link_to "join the chat on gitter", "https://gitter.im/codebar/tutorials"} to offer help and guidance outside the workshops.
