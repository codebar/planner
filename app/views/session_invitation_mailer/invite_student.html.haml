                  In our workshops, you can work through any of our #{link_to "tutorials", "http://codebar.github.io/tutorials" } or get help and guidance on another technology for your personal project. We believe that everyone should be entitled to free learning and our community has #{ link_to "a lot of devoted developers", full_url_for(coaches_url)} who help out by coaching.
                %p You will also get the opportunity to meet other people interested in coding and collaborate with them.
                %p Please note: We do not accept any RSVPs over email.

                %p.callout If you are working through the tutorials outside our workshop, or need any other help or advice #{ link_to "join the codebar Slack", "https://codebar-slack.herokuapp.com"}.
