%h1 Hi #{@member.name}!

%p Welcome to codebar. We're looking forward to seeing you at one of our events soon.

%p
  - if @member.subscriptions.any?
    You'll automatically receive email invitations to our workshops as soon as a workshop is open for RSVP.
    - if @member.chapters.pluck(:name).include?("London")
      However, our London chapter doesn't send workshop invitations via email, so you won't receive email invites for regular London events. We open RSVPs at around 1pm on the Friday before the workshop, and you will be able to register through the workshop page on our website. To be notified when we open RSVPs, join the #london-chapters channel

    We send out invitations to our events via email.

  Places are limited, so be sure to respond quickly if you want to attend.

  Our workshops are available to women, LGBTQ people, and others under-represented
  in the tech industry. If you belong to one of these groups, you are more than welcome
  to attend. You can find out more about codebar's workshops

%p
  Each workshop starts with around 30 minutes of socialising and food, before we assign
  you to a coach with one to three other students. You can either work through
  = link_to "one of our tutorials", "http://tutorials.codebar.io/"
  or get help with your own project. After 2 hours of coaching, we retire to a nearby
  pub for some post-codebar relaxation.

%p
  It's important to us that our workshops are a welcoming &amp; accepting environment
  for everyone. Please make sure you

  If you have any questions, reply to this email or chat to one of the organisers at
  the workshop. We'll be at the table with the name stickers. We're here to help
  with anything on your mind.

%p We hope to see you at a workshop soon!
