  Places are limited, so be sure to respond quickly if you want to attend.

  Our workshops are available to women, LGBTQ people, and others under-represented
  in the tech industry. If you belong to one of these groups, you are more than welcome
  to attend. You can find out more about codebar's workshops

  Each workshop starts with around 30 minutes of socialising and food, before we assign
  you to a coach with one to three other students. You can either work through

  or get help with your own project. After 2 hours of coaching, we retire to a nearby
  pub for some post-codebar relaxation.

  It's important to us that our workshops are a welcoming &amp; accepting environment
  for everyone. Please make sure you

  with anything on your mind.
