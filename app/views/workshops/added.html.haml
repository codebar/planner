        %h1 You're coming to Codebar!
        %p
          Thanks for signing up to this Codebar event! We're looking forward to seeing you.
          Please be sure you've read our #{link_to 'Code of Conduct', code_of_conduct_path} before attending.

        - if @coach
          %p As a coach, you don't need to bring anything except patience and a willingness to teach. It can be handy to have a notebok and pen, though.
        - else
          %p You'll need to bring your laptop with you, but you shouldn't need anything else.

        %p
          We're looking forward to seeing you at Codebar soon!
