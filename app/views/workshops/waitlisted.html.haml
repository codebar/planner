          You've been added to the waiting list for this Codebar event. We can't guarantee you a place, but we get a lot of cancellations on the day.
          %strong We strongly recommend you pack everything you need, as we may give you a place on short notice.

        %p Please be sure you've read our #{link_to 'Code of Conduct', code_of_conduct_path} before attending.

        - if @coach
          %p As a coach, you don't need to bring anything except patience and a willingness to teach. It can be handy to have a notebok and pen, though.
        - else
          %p As a student, you'll need to bring your laptop with you, but you shouldn't need anything else.

        %p
          We hope to see you at Codebar soon!
