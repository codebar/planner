        %h1 Sorry to see you go. ☹
        %p
          We're sad that you can't make it to this Codebar event - but thanks for letting us know!
          By cancelling your attendance, you're letting us give your place to someone else on the waiting list. And that's awesome.

        %p
          Even though you can't make it to this Codebar, we're looking forward to seeing you at another Codebar soon!

          if you have any questions.
