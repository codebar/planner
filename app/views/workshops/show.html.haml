        %p.exposition Our workshops are a safe, supportive environment that help you learn web development at your own pace. We start with around 30 minutes of socialising, before students are divided into small groups with a coach. Students spend a couple of hours working through the <a href="http://tutorials.codebar.io">tutorials</a> (or on their own project) with their coach's help, before we retire to a nearby pub for a quiet drink.
