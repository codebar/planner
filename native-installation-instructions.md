# Installing Ruby/Postgres on your local environment

These are the original instructions for natively installing the app to your machine, using local installations of Ruby and Postgres. For most people, we recommend [using Docker instead](README.md).

## Set up a Ruby Environment

You will need to install Ruby 2.4.2 using RVM or rbenv.

### Option 1: Using [rvm](https://rvm.io/rvm/install)

```bash
rvm install 2.4.2
```

### Option 2: Using [rbenv](https://github.com/sstephenson/rbenv) and [ruby-build](https://github.com/sstephenson/ruby-build)

```bash
rbenv install 2.4.2
rbenv global 2.4.2
```

## Install and run PostgreSQL

[The PostgreSQL Wiki has detailed installation guides](https://wiki.postgresql.org/wiki/Detailed_installation_guides) for various platforms, but probably the simplest and most common method for Mac users is with Homebrew:

### Using [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/) on a Mac

Note: You might need to install another build of Xcode Tools (typing `brew update` in the terminal will prompt you to update the Xcode build tools).

Install Postgres:
```bash
brew update
brew install postgresql
brew services start postgresql
```

Install other dependencies:
```
brew install imagemagick
```

Install the Gems:
```bash
gem install bundler
bundle install --without production
```

## Set up the Database

Adjust `config/database.yml` as needed.

```bash
bundle exec rake db:create
bundle exec rake db:migrate db:test:prepare
```

*Note:* If you are running OSX Yosemite, you may experience a problem connecting to
Postgres. [This stackoverflow answer](http://stackoverflow.com/a/26458194/1510063) might help.

### Generate sample data

```bash
bundle exec rake db:seed
```

## Run the app

```bash
bundle exec rails server
```

### Run the tests

```bash
bundle exec rake
```
