A tool to help manage [codebar.io](https://codebar.io) members and events.

If you are considering making a PR, please take a look at the [GitHub issues](https://github.com/codebar/planner/issues) to see if there are any new feature requirements or bugs that you maybe able to help resolve.

## Getting Started

The following steps walk through getting the application running. Before you start, please check out our [contributing guidelines](https://github.com/codebar/planner/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md).

1. [Clone the project](#1-clone-the-project)
2. [Enable GitHub Authentication](#2-enable-github-authentication)
3. [Install and set up the environment](#3-install-and-set-up-the-environment)
4. [Run the tests](#4-run-the-tests)
5. [Start the app](#5-start-the-app)

### 1. Clone the project

1. Navigate to your project's chosen parent directory, e.g. `cd ~/Documents/codebar`
2. [Clone the project](https://help.github.com/articles/cloning-a-repository/), e.g. `git clone git@github.com:codebar/planner.git`
3. Navigate into the project directory: `cd planner`

### 2. Enable GitHub Authentication

The application uses GitHub OAuth for user authentication. You'll need to create a new OAuth application on your GitHub account, then add the key and secret to your project's environment variables.

#### Create a new Github OAuth application

Visit [https://github.com/settings/applications/new](https://github.com/settings/applications/new) and fill out the form to create a new application. Use these field values:

| Field | Value |
| --- | --- |
| Application name | Something memorable, like 'codebar planner' |
| Homepage URL | `http://localhost:3000` |
| Application description | Something memorable, like 'Local codebar app authentication'. |
| Authorization Callback URL | `http://localhost:3000/auth/github` |

#### Add your application details to your environment variables

##### Mac/Linux:
1. Run `touch .env` to create a file named `.env` in the root of the application folder.
2. Open this .env file in a text editor, and add the GitHub key (Client ID) and secret (Client Secret) like so:
```
    GITHUB_KEY=YOUR_KEY
    GITHUB_SECRET=YOUR_SECRET
```

##### Windows:
Windows doesn't like creating a file named `.env`, so run the following
from a command prompt in your project folder:
```
    echo GITHUB_KEY=YOUR_KEY >> .env
    echo GITHUB_SECRET=YOUR_SECRET >> .env
```

### 3. Install and set up the environment

We recommend using Docker to install and run the application. However alternatively if you prefer, [you can install directly to your system environment instead](https://github.com/codebar/planner/blob/master/native-installation-instructions.md).

#### Install using Docker

Before you start, you will need to have Docker installed and running. You can [download it from the Docker website](https://docker.com/).

The current Dockerfile and docker-compose were closely copied from [the Docker guide](https://docs.docker.com/compose/rails/).

1. Run `bin/dbuild` to build and setup the docker environment.
2. Run `bin/drake` to run all the tests and make sure everything works.

### 4. Run the tests

Run `bin/drake` to run all the tests and make sure everything works.
You can also use `bin/drails` and `bin/dspec` to run specific rails and rspec commands via docker.

#### Running single tests/test files

If you just want to run a single test file you can pass the path to the file, either using `rspec` or via the `SPEC` variable with `rake`:
```bash
bundle exec rspec <path to test>
bundle exec rake SPEC=<path to test>
```

This can also be used with specific line number (running only that one test), for example:
```bash
bundle exec rspec spec/features/admin/manage_workshop_attendances_spec.rb:42
bundle exec rake SPEC=spec/features/admin/manage_workshop_attendances_spec.rb:42
```

These also work with the corresponding `bin/dspec` and `bin/drake` commands.

#### Running JavaScript enabled feature tests with a visible browser
There are a small number of feature tests marked with `js: true` which use
headless Chrome. These can be hard to work with without being able to see what is
actually happening in the browser. To spin up a visible browser, pass
`CHROME_HEADLESS=false` as part of the test command, for example:

```bash
CHROME_HEADLESS=false bundle exec rspec
```

Running JavaScript enabled tests with a visible browser currently doesn't work with Docker.

### 5. Start the app

Run `bin/dstart` to start the app.

This should run a process which starts a server in a Docker container on your computer. This process won't finish - you'll know the server is ready when it stops doing anything and displays a message like this:
```
Rails 4.2.11 application starting in development on http://0.0.0.0:3000
```

**You can now view the app at http://localhost:3000**

You can stop the server when you're finished by typing `Ctrl + C`.

## Front-end framework

We use Foundation at version 5.5.3, you can find the documentation here: http://foundation.zurb.com/sites/docs/v/5.5.3/

## Finding something to work on

You can pick one of the open [issues](https://github.com/codebar/planner/issues), fix a bug, improve the interface, refactor the code or improve test coverage!

If there is something else that you would like to work on, open an issue first so we can discuss it. We are always open to new ideas and ways of improving planner!
