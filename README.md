## Getting Started

The following steps walk through getting the application running. For contributing guidelines see [here](https://github.com/codebar/planner/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md).

### Setting up a Ruby Environment

You will need to install Ruby 2.4.2 using RVM or rbenv.

#### Using [rvm](https://rvm.io/rvm/install)

```bash
rvm install 2.4.2
```

#### Using [rbenv](https://github.com/sstephenson/rbenv) and [ruby-build](https://github.com/sstephenson/ruby-build)

```bash
rbenv install 2.4.2
rbenv global 2.4.2
```

### Install and run PostgreSQL
[The PostgreSQL Wiki has detailed installation guides](https://wiki.postgresql.org/wiki/Detailed_installation_guides) for various platforms, but probably the simplest and most common method for Mac users is with Homebrew:

#### Using [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/) on a Mac
Note: You might need to install another build of Xcode Tools (typing `brew update` in the terminal will prompt you to update the Xcode build tools).
```bash
brew update
brew install postgresql
brew services start postgresql
```

### Install the Gems!

```bash
gem install bundler
bundle install --without production
```

### Setup the Database

Adjust `config/database.yml` as needed.

```bash
bundle exec rake db:create
bundle exec rake db:migrate db:test:prepare
```

*Note:* If you are running OSX Yosemite, you may experience a problem connecting to
Postgres. [This stackoverflow answer](http://stackoverflow.com/a/26458194/1510063) might help.

### Enable GitHub Authentication

The application uses GitHub OAuth for user authentication.

#### Create a GitHub application

Using these field values:

| Field | Value |
| --- | --- |
| Homepage URL | `http://localhost:3000` |
| Authorization Callback URL | `http://localhost:3000/auth/github` |

Create an application at [https://github.com/settings/applications/new](https://github.com/settings/applications/new).

#### Add your application details to your environment

Create a file named `.env` in the root of the application folder (`touch .env`)
with the GitHub key and secret like so:

    GITHUB_KEY=YOUR_KEY
    GITHUB_SECRET=YOUR_SECRET

*Note:* Windows doesn't like creating a file named `.env` so do the following
from a cmd prompt in your application folder:

    echo GITHUB_KEY=YOUR_KEY >> .env
    echo GITHUB_SECRET=YOUR_SECRET >> .env

Also within this file you will need to add:

    GITHUB_USERNAME=YOUR_USERNAME
    GITHUB_PASSWORD=YOUR_PASSWORD

### Generate some sample data

```bash
bundle exec rake db:seed
```

### Run the app

```bash
bundle exec rails server
```

### Run the tests

```bash
bundle exec rake
```

*Note:* JavaScript acceptance tests are relying on the [Poltergeist](https://github.com/teampoltergeist/poltergeist) driver, which requires
[PhantomJS](http://phantomjs.org). For more information about installing PhantomJS, please take a look
[here](https://github.com/teampoltergeist/poltergeist#installing-phantomjs).

## Front-end framework

We use Foundation at version 5.5.3, you can find the documentation here: http://foundation.zurb.com/sites/docs/v/5.5.3/

## Finding something to work on
You can pick one of the open [issues](https://github.com/codebar/planner/issues), fix a bug, improve the interface, refactor the code or improve test coverage!

If there is something else that you would like to work on, open an issue first so we can discuss it. We are always open to new ideas and ways of improving planner!

## UI Testing

At [Sparta Global](https://www.spartaglobal.com/), a final project was proposed to develop a UI testing suite for CodeBar's website.
For this Sparta consultants from the SDET stream had to write some business requirements that should represent the main actions of a real user on CodeBar website. This involved actions like:
- Signing In/Up/Out (this has github dependency)
- Attend Workshops
- Cancel Workshops
- Post new jobs

Our goal was to test against those requirements and we used Capybara for it.

### What is Capybara?

Capybara is a software testing framework for behaviour-driven development. It allows you to write your tests and while the script is being executed on your console, you can see the tests being run in real time on the browser using the data that was given in your code. Capybara utilises Cucumber software.

### What is UI Testing?
After going through all the process of the V-Model, unit testing, integration testing, system testing we've come to acceptance testing. In this phase, testing is performed against the user requirements, checking if it meets the acceptance criteria.

According with ISTQB Glossary, Acceptance Testing is:

> Formal testing with respect to user needs, requirements, and business processes conducted to determine whether or not a system satisfies the acceptance criteria and to enable the user, customers or other authorised entity to determine whether or not to accept the system. http://glossary.istqb.org/search/acceptance%20testing

### What is POM (Page Object Model)?
Testing using the POM allow us to write a clean and more reusable code. This implies, like the name suggests, to create a different test for each page. On the website fields like :id, :class, or :name are accessed and data can be inserted in order to validate them.

### How To Test
- Git clone this repository
- On your console move into the folder where this repository is cloned.
- Run bundle install to make sure you have all the required gems installed.
```
bundle install
```
After all the gems are installed, you need to move into the _ui testing_ folder and run cucumber from there.
```
cd ui_testing
cucumber
```
While tests are running the browser will open and run the script.
Results can be seen on your console (either passed, green, or failed, red)
