      a: "We have a variety of available tutorials in HTML, CSS, Javascript and Ruby. If you want to learn something else don't hesitate to <a href=\"mailto:contact@codebar.io\">send us an email</a> as we might still be able to find someone to help you out."
    eligibility:
      q: "I want to attend a workshop. Am I eligible?"
      a: "Our workshops are available to women, LGBTQ and people who are underrepresented in the tech industry. If you belong to one of these groups, you are more than welcome to attend. If not, there are some other great initiatives like <a href=\"http://www.meetup.com/opentechschool-london\">Open Tech School London</a> where you can learn in a collaborative environment."
    career:
      q: "Is Codebar only aimed at people who want to move into a career as a developer?"
      a: "No! Codebar is about getting people excited about programming. We'll help them learn some basic coding skills, as well as how to explore and do things on their own. For those who do want to become developers, we will provide help and guidance to help them achieve their goal."
    format:
      q: "What is the format of the workshops?"
      a: "We try to have one coach for every two students. We will pair up students who want to work on the same tutorial, and assign them a coach. The rest just happens."
    laptop:
      q: "Do I need to bring a laptop with me at the workshops?"
      a: "Yes, we suggest that you bring a laptop as it will be easier for you to carry on working on things after the workshops. It you don't have one, <a href=\"mailto:contact@codebar.io\">send us an email</a> so we can try and help out."
    online_resources:
      q: "There are so many online resources, why should I come to Codebar?"

    location:
      q: "Where do the workshops take place?"

    disabled_access:
      q: "Is there disabled access at the workshops?"

    bring_codebar_to_my_city:
      q: "I would like to bring Codebar to my city. Can I do that?"
      a: "Of course. Codebar is about building a community of experienced developers that are able to give up some of their time to help others. If you are keen on running Codebar where you live, we would love to speak to you about it and see how we can help make this happen, so send <a href=\"mailto:contact@codebar.io\">us an email</a>.Of course.
