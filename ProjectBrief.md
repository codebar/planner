# Sparta - Final Project

Well done everyone for making it through to the final project. We are coming to the time where we have more and more interviews or you may already be placed in your first role. The aim for this final project is to get you ready to move into your first role here at Sparta Global and gear you up for what you will be doing as technical consultants.

>**You must successfully pass this project in order to graduate the Sparta Academy**

Once again we will be assessing everything that you produce during the next two weeks. We will need you provide work that is at the highest quality so to give us reassurance that you are ready to be put on site.

The project is going to be a group project and last 2 weeks. You will need to create a final presentation which you will repeat at your Graduation.

## Task

Your task is to create an automation suite for the Codebar website - https://github.com/codebar/planner. Once you have cloned the repo locally you will see there is already a lot of testing already in place. It is going to be your job to analyse what the current test coverage is over the site and make decisions where best to continue the automation testing.

This is going to be a long project and is not only going to involve coding but is also going to be about the decisions you make and how you document them. **This is going to be your first REAL consultant project**. We will need to see the following:-

* Great team work and communication
* Clear and useful planning which is kept up to date
* Regular sprints and use of the SCRUM ceremonies
* High quality documentation that is created at every stage of the project
* Consultant level decisions and attitude
* Meaningful and high quality tests created
* Work log for each individual team member

## Aim

The aim for this project is to add value to the Codebar site. This might entail:-

* Making a pull request at the end of your project with your work
* Submitting issues on Codebar's Github with defects or things you have found
* Communicating findings with the Codebar dev team
